Hello everyone, in this code I tried to create a slot machine. 
In which you have the opportunity to spin and get cashback,
depending on which line you come across. 
When your dollars run out, a field appears in which you can add a little amount.
Your starting amount is $1000 and each spin is worth $300.
I used local storage to save data...
During different wins, you see the fruits won and the amount won too.
When you hit the same fruit 9 times, you will win the $10K Jackpot. During different wins, a certain amount is added to your account, for example: 50$, 100$ etc.
When you don't have enough dollars in your account and you try to click to spin, you get an insufficient funds message.
I tried to take into account all possible misunderstandings and tried to create an application that works without errors.
The only drawback is that we cannot choose how much to bet.
I hope you like my created application, some animations and performance.
I wish you happy coding.
